## 📁 Project Structure

**Part 1: Traditional Machine Learning**
- `linear_regression.py` - Basic linear models
- `softmax.py` - Multi-class classification  
- `svm.py` - Support Vector Machines
- `features.py` - Feature engineering
- `kernel.py` - Kernel methods

- `train_utils.py` - Training utilities

## 🔍 The Problem
The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 handwritten digits (0-9) that humans recognize easily but computers historically struggled with. Each 28×28 pixel image presents challenges: handwriting variations, different stroke styles, and positional inconsistencies. The advanced challenge adds two overlapping digits that must be recognized separately.

## 🚧 Challenges Faced
1. **High Dimensionality**: 784 features per image
2. **Non-linear Patterns**: Digits aren't linearly separable
3. **Overlapping Digits**: Predicting two digits simultaneously
4. **Performance Optimization**: Balancing accuracy with training time
5. **Generalization**: Working on unseen handwriting styles

## 📊 Results Comparison

| Method | Architecture | Single-Digit | Two-Digit | Key Insight |
|--------|--------------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| Linear Regression | Basic linear | 23.03% | N/A | Too simple for images |
| SVM (RBF Kernel) | Kernel method | 93.64% | N/A | Great with feature engineering |
| Neural Network | Manual (NumPy) | 85%+ | N/A | Educational foundation |
| Fully Connected | 1 hidden layer | 97.46% | 92.26% | Deep learning advantage |
| **Convolutional** | **2 conv layers** | **99.19%** | **97.74%** | **Best for visual patterns** |

**Key Finding**: Convolutional Neural Networks outperformed all other methods, demonstrating superior capability for image recognition.

## 🌍 Real-World Applications
These techniques power technologies you use daily:

**Everyday Uses:**

**Business Impact:** A 99% accurate system processes 10,000 documents with only 100 errors vs. 2,300 errors with linear methods—saving hundreds of work hours monthly.

## 🎓 Conclusion
This project shows a fundamental truth in computer vision: **while simple models provide insights, deep learning—particularly convolutional networks—delivers production-ready performance.** The progression from 23% to 99% accuracy mirrors the industry's journey from basic algorithms to today's AI revolution.

The skills demonstrated form the foundation for tackling complex computer vision problems in healthcare, autonomous systems, and beyond.
